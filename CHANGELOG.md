## Old Releases
- 0.9.9.4: improve page blob upload algorithm to skip empty max size pages.
  fix zero length file uploads. fix single file upload that's skipped.
- 0.9.9.3: fix downloading of blobs with content length of zero
- 0.9.9.1: fix content length > 32bit for blob lists via SAS on Python2
- 0.9.9.0: update script for compatibility with new Azure Python packages
- 0.9.8: fix blob endpoint for non-SAS input, add retry on ServerBusy
- 0.9.7: normalize SAS keys (accept keys with or without ? char prefix)
- 0.9.6: revert local resource path expansion, PEP8 fixes
- 0.9.5: fix directory creation issue
- 0.9.4: fix Python3 compatibility issues
- 0.9.3: the script supports page blob uploading. To specify local files to
  upload as page blobs, specify the `--pageblob` parameter. The script also
  has a feature to detect files ending in the `.vhd` extension and will
  automatically upload just these files as page blobs while uploading other
  files as block blobs. Specify the `--autovhd` parameter (without the
  `--pageblob` parameter) to enable this behavior.
- 0.9.0: the script will automatically default to skipping files where if the
  MD5 checksum of either the local file or the stored MD5 of the remote
  resource respectively matches the remote resource or local file, then the
  upload or download for the file will be skipped. This capability will allow
  one to perform rsync-like operations where only files that have changed will
  be transferred. This behavior can be forcefully disabled by specifying
  `--no-skiponmatch`.
- 0.8.2: performance regression fixes
